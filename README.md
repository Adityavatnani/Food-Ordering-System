## Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of our **Food Ordering System Project**, built collaboratively as part of our BCA Major Project.

It includes:

- React component-based UI development  
- Express & Node.js backend development  
- MongoDB database modeling  
- REST API architecture  
- State management, routing & authentication  
- Admin-driven CRUD operations  
- Full-stack project structuring & deployment readiness
